## Stretch Goals

To extend parallax functionality across mobile devices.
Fix text overlap and alter CSS layout to display table for the paragraph text within events and grid for the body.
Fix menu overlap on some devices around the 300px width mark.
Use BEM CSS across the site. 
Improve accessibility, adding more specific and detailed descriptions and aria.
